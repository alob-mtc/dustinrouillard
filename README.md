**Welcome to my GitHub Profile**

If you look below at my pinned repositories you can see a table which automatically updates which contains the last 7 days of some different statistics.

Once I get around to it I will be moving that table up to here and adding more and more data. :)

> This is a very neat way to tell people more about yourself and what you do :)

#### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹ 

My name's Dustin, I'm 20 years old, live in Vancouver, Canada, and I'm the CTO and Co-Founder of [Notify Technology, Inc.](https://notify.me) 

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer who is obsessed with scalable infrastructure, kubernetes is seriously part of my life now.

I'm the Full-Time CTO and Systems Administrator at [Notify](https://notify.me), but in my spare time I write a lot of code for personal projects such as the api that updates the table below, and I also do things for [Hiven](https://hiven.io) when I'm needed.
